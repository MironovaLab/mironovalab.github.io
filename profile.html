SHORT PROFESSIONAL INTRODUCTION (5–6 sentences)
[Full Name] is a [current position, e.g., Associate Professor / Group Leader] in the [Department/Institute] at [University]. Their work focuses on computational and experimental plant developmental biology, with an emphasis on regulatory network architecture, cell fate specification, and quantitative organ-scale modeling. A central research objective is to integrate single-cell transcriptomics, spatial genomics, and digital-twin modeling to understand emergent behaviors in plant tissues. Their group works across dry-lab and wet-lab modalities, maintains multiple open-source analytical resources, and collaborates with academic and industrial partners.

TEACHING (1 short paragraph)
[Last name] teaches across multiple MSc and PhD-level courses in plant genomics, computational biology, and single-cell analysis. Instruction emphasizes quantitative reasoning, reproducible research practices, and direct exposure to current literature. The group regularly supervises MSc thesis projects and offers research-based training in high-dimensional data analysis, imaging-integrated workflows, and manuscript preparation.
